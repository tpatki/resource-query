1) node_dist.hpp inclusion and variable declaration should be optimized based on the policy.
2) error codes from node_dist.hpp need checking
3) encode the perf_class for just the node using properties, instead of the current wasteful mechanism
4) Script to generate random job traces for testing
5) Script for generating the performance class file (from raw data of quartz or cab)
6) In a separate branch, cherry pick the perf_assist files, and add the slowdown for job times (basically, assume users specify duration based on best nodes).
